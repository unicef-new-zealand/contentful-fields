# Contentful Color Palette
This Contentful UI extension lets you configure a field to accept colors from
a brand palette, ensuring you have clean data, and letting the editors easily
see a list of colors.

## Installation
Follow the steps in [the main README](/README.md) and then configure your
color palette. There are two ways to do this:
### Installation Palette
You can configure the colors for your entire workspace under the extension's settings.
Under "Colors" provide a string of comma separated hex values, such as:
`#F26A21, #1CABE2, #FFC20E, #80BD41, #E2231A`

### Instance Palette
If you don't want to configure it for the entire workspace, or you want to override
the colors for a specific field, this is the way to configure it.
When setting a field to use the extension, there's an additional "Colors" setting
available. Use a string of comma separated hex values to set this, eg.
`#F26A21, #1CABE2, #FFC20E, #80BD41, #E2231A`
